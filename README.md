Repository with artifacts for https://medium.com/@enryu9000/lookism-in-tiktok-3def0f20cf78.

Notebooks are in the `*.ipynb` files, checkpoints for the models from these notebooks - in the `checkpoints` subdirectory (one can `load_model()` them).

For face editing: `tiktok_boundary.npy` has the vector, `stylegan_inference.ipynb` is a slightly modified version of the inferente notebook from https://github.com/yuval-alaluf/stylegan3-editing.
